 *   administrator can help. Another server's overQuota may stand for any
 *   sending limit, so its own description goes with a generic sentence;
 * - a timeout, which is not a clean failure: the submission may have reached
 *   the server and gone out, with only the answer lost. Saying "send failed"
 *   would invite a re-send and a duplicate, so point at Sent instead (#702);
 * - a hold beyond the server's limit;
 * - every recipient refused: the server took the submission, so nothing
 *   else would say that the message went nowhere. Its reply per address
